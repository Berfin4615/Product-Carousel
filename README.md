# 🛒 Product Carousel (Vanilla JS)

A lightweight and responsive **product carousel** built with pure **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**—no frameworks, no libraries. Just like the one on e‑bebek’s console script!

## 🚀 Features

- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript** – No dependencies or external libraries.
- **Responsive by default** – Desktop, tablet, and mobile-friendly.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **HTML**: Defines a container (`.carousel`) with a list of items.
- **CSS**: Positions items horizontally, hides overflow, and styles navigation.
- **JS**: Handles loop logic, active slide tracking, and next/prev navigation.

## 🔧 Customization

- Tweak transition duration or timing via CSS.
- Add autoplay, dot indicators, or touch swipe enhancement.
- Adjust slide width or number of visible items with CSS.
